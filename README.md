# steam-deck-audio-disabler
The script located in this repo will allow you to disable and/or re-enable the onboard audio drivers thus providing a bandaid for shorted audio buttons. This is a permanent bandaide and the onboard audio will remain disabled until you run the enable script. Bluetooth audio and 3.5mm audio will continue to work but will need to be controlled within the settings.
